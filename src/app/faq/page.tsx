      <h2>What time should I arrive on the day?</h2>
      <p>Please plan to arrive between 2 and 2:15pm so we can get everyone seated and settled. We’ll be kicking off at 2:30pm on the dot. </p>

      <h2>What’s the weather like in Yorkshire in November?</h2>
      <p>Honestly, who can say. Expect it to be chilly, maybe rainy, probably overcast, perhaps sunny, potentially all at once. All activities will be indoors, so you won’t have to worry about getting rained on, but in the UK it’s always best to bring layers.</p>

      <h2>What’s the dress code?</h2>
      <p>Party clothes! If you’re like us, you probably spend a lot of time in “athleisure”, aka PJs and slippers. This is your chance to dust off those old suits and dancing shoes. To us that means cocktail/semi-formal attire for ladies, dress shirts and trousers at minimum for guys. Just make sure you’re comfortable moving around and being on your feet.</p>

      <h2>Can I bring a plus one?</h2>
      <p>We love that you have friends! Friends are so important! But in this case, we’d be grateful if you didn’t bring any surprise extra friends to our wedding. If you’re allowed to bring a plus one it will say so explicitly on your invite.</p>

      <h2>Can I bring my child?</h2>
      <p>We respect all lifestyle choices and are deeply impressed that you are raising a human. That said, please leave your kid at home. This is a party for grown-ups. We really do have to insist on this one.</p>

      <h2>Can I bring my dog?</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately the venue is not pet-friendly, so your pooch will need to stay behind. You can bring pictures, though!</p>

      <h2>Can I take pictures at the wedding?</h2>
      <p>Heck yeah. Just please don’t take any during the ceremony, because it interferes with our photographers’ ability to get good shots.</p>

      <h2>I love social media. Can I post about you guys?</h2>
      <p>Go for it. We don’t use it much ourselves so any social coverage will need to come from you anyway. Feel free to tag Eve on Instagram at <a className="text-pink" href="https://www.instagram.com/evebinder">@evebinder</a> (Josh doesn’t have social media).</p>

      <h2>Good god, this sounds like a long day.</h2>
      <p>We know. People in the UK go hard at weddings, but not everyone is used to this level of revelry (including us). To help you power through, we’ll have spaces available for “recharge time”: reading, answering texts, joining Eve’s dad on the couch for a nap, whatever you want. We’ll also have lots of games that you can play either with others on your own. Just try to stick around until the pub quiz, because you might win a prize!</p>

      <h2>What’s your policy on gifts?</h2>
      <p>We know how expensive weddings can be to attend, and we’re just happy you’re able to join us. If giving a gift feels important to you, you can contribute to our Empty Post-Wedding Bank Accounts Honeymoon Fund here. We’ll also have a place for cards at the venue if that’s more your thing.</p>

      <h2>I’m arriving early/staying an extra day. What can I do nearby?</h2>
      <p>Awesome! West Yorkshire is absolutely beautiful, so we recommend taking a country walk if the weather is nice. You can find some good trails here. Halifax itself also has some cool sites, including Piece Hall and, randomly, the “world’s tallest folly.” If you’re willing to travel a little farther, we’d wholeheartedly suggest taking the train to York, which is a gorgeous medieval town with loads of shops and pretty streets, plus a truly unhinged museum.</p>

      <h2>I have another question.</h2>
      <p>We’re here to help! Email us <a className="text-pink" href="mailto:eve.binder@gmail.com">here</a>.</p>
